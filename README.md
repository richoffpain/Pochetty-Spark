# Pochetty-Spark
Pochetty Spark is a website clone that I decided to work on after finishing a course on Udemy. It has a lot of properties that are a little irrevelevant to modern development
and Im conscious about it. It was a way for me to implement everything that I learned so far. And a future obviously I will implement some javascript into it 
to make the toggle and other stuff interactive but for now, its that. 
And the div footer is a mistake of mine that I will fix later on too.

IMPORTANT
MINI COMPUTER TO HIGHER RESOLUTION SCREEN IS YET TO BE CUSTOMIZED AND BEING BUG FREE
ALSO I DEPLOY IT ON NETLIFY SO YOU HAVE A BETTER PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT
